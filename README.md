# Okavango Delta Rivers and Tributaries Visualization

This visualisation focuses on depicting rivers and tributaries for the Okavango Delta using the [HydroSHEDS dataset](https://www.hydrosheds.org/). HydroSHEDS is a mapping product that provides hydrographic information for regional and global-scale applications in a consistent format. It was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Conservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research of the University of Kassel, Germany.

## Dataset
The primary dataset used for this visualization is the HydroSHEDS dataset. It provides detailed hydrographic information, including rivers, tributaries, and other water-related features, in a consistent format. The HydroSHEDS dataset is widely used for hydrological and environmental analyses and is suitable for regional and global-scale applications.

## Visualization
The visualization of the rivers and tributaries in the Okavango Delta was performed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. GEE provides a powerful and interactive environment for analyzing geospatial data and generating visualizations. By leveraging the capabilities of GEE, we were able to efficiently process and display the HydroSHEDS data.
